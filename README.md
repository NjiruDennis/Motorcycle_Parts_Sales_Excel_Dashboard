## Recommendations

Based on these findings, the following actions are recommended:

- üí≥ **Promote credit card use**: Since it's the most used payment method, consider offering promotions tied to credit card payments.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Invest in top-performing lines**: Expand inventory or marketing for Engine and Suspension categories.
- üßæ **Segment clients for upsell**: Create pricing strategies that better serve high-volume wholesale buyers.
- üì¶ **Warehouse optimization**: Analyze operations in the North warehouse to replicate success elsewhere.
- üìà **Seasonal strategy**: Align marketing campaigns with July demand spikes.

---

## Limitations

- Data only spans **three months** ‚Äî trends may not reflect long-term patterns.
- **Client identities** are not included, so customer-level behavior can‚Äôt be tracked.
- No product-level granularity beyond category (`product_line`), which limits deep pricing or SKU analysis.
